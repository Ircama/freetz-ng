  - Package: [master/make/pkgs/ldd/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/pkgs/ldd/)

**ldd** stands for **L**ist **D**ynamic **D**ependencies. It is a small
console tool that can be used to determine whether a binary depends on
other binaries (usually [dynamic libraries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries))
and if so, which ones.

As the description correctly suggests, *ldd* is typically used by
developers - whereas the "normal user" rarely needs it, if at all.
