		pip is the package installer for Python 3.
		
		Allows you to install and manage additional Python packages
		from PyPI (Python Package Index) and other sources.
		
		Common uses:
		- Install pure-Python packages on the router
		- Manage Python package dependencies
		- Install packages from PyPI, git, local files
		- Upgrade and uninstall packages
		
		Usage examples:
		  pip3 install requests
		  pip3 install flask
		  pip3 list
		  pip3 uninstall package-name
		
		Note: For packages with C extensions, it's better to
		use pre-compiled modules from the "3rd-party modules" menu.
		Pip works best for pure-Python packages.
