# GCC Toolchain externalization
# 
# All GCC toolchain files are packaged inside a special marker directory
# GCC_TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE/ which is recognized by tools/external script.
#
# The external script will:
# 1. Detect GCC_TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE/ in the filesystem
# 2. Move its CONTENTS (not the directory itself) to external/
# 3. Remove the empty GCC_TOOLCHAIN_ARCHIVE/ directory
# 4. Create symlinks in filesystem/ pointing to /mod/external/...
#
# This approach ensures complete isolation of gcc-toolchain files and prevents
# any conflicts with firmware libraries or other packages.

# Marker for gcc-toolchain archive (tools/external will unpack this)
