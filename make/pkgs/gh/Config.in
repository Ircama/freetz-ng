		gh is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and
		other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already
		working with git and your code.
		
		GitHub CLI provides a more efficient way to interact with GitHub
		repositories, issues, pull requests, and more from your terminal.
		
		Can be externalized to save flash memory.
