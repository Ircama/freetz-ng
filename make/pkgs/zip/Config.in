		zip - package and compress (archive) files

		Zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
		OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh, Amiga, and Acorn RISC OS.
		It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1) and compress(1)
		and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).

		This utility is essential for creating compressed archives on the target
		system, especially useful for packaging files and reducing storage space.
		
		Can be externalized to save flash memory.
