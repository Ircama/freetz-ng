		pandas is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library.
		
		WARNING: Requires NumPy (currently developer-only).
		
		Provides:
		- DataFrame and Series data structures
		- Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data
		- Reshaping and pivoting of data sets
		- Label-based slicing, indexing, and subsetting
		- Time series functionality
		- Data I/O (CSV, Excel, SQL, HDF5, JSON, Parquet)
		
		Common uses:
		- Data cleaning and preparation
		- Statistical analysis
		- Time series analysis
		- Data visualization (with matplotlib)
		
		WARNING: pandas is large (~10-15 MB) and REQUIRES NumPy.
		Both MUST be externalized to USB storage.
