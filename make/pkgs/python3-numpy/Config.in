		NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
		
		NEW: NumPy 2.3.3 with Meson build system (compatible with Python 3.13).
		Cross-compilation tested but may have edge cases.
		
		Provides:
		- Powerful N-dimensional array object (ndarray)
		- Sophisticated broadcasting functions
		- Linear algebra, Fourier transform, random number capabilities
		- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
		
		Common uses:
		- Data analysis and machine learning
		- Scientific and engineering computations
		- Image and signal processing
		- Statistical operations
		
		WARNING: NumPy is large (~15-20 MB) and MUST be externalized.
		Ensure sufficient USB storage is available.
		
		This build uses reference BLAS (slower but no extra dependencies).
		For performance-critical applications, consider optimized libraries.
